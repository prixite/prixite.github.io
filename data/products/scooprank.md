I have always had conversations and debates where one tries to convince the other about the popularity of ‘his’ leader and vice versa! And the result? Always a zero multiplied by zero! No one has any stats and evidence to gauge “popularity” or look at how something is trending against the other. And this is where ScoopRank silently kicks in!

###### **Key Features of ScoopRank: **

This was a very brief Introduction to ScoopRank! Let’s dive deeper into the capabilities of ScoopRank!

**1. Scoops**

Every second, news is generated and posted online through different sources. A scoop is formed of the news in the same context but can have numerous different sources. ScoopRank then assigns them categories and writes a summary for each one. e.g. news about Fawad Chaudhary’s bail was published through several sources. But only one scoop will form on the same because all of them have the same context.

**2. Sentiment Analysis**

One of the most powerful features of ScoopRank is the sentiment analysis of the entities. It is pertinent to note that this is not the sentiment of the public but is based on the news article; its tone, references, and where the article leads to. For example, the entity “Imran Khan” was searched and the trends appeared over the timeline. Hovering over one particular date shows the sentiment analysis of the entity for that day.
