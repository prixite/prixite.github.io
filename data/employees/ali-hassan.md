moreInfoOne: "In Ali's recent project, he played a pivotal role in crafting a sophisticated search engine tailored for codebases. This powerful tool enables users to pose questions and swiftly retrieve relevant code snippets and insights. Ali took on the responsibility of creating a GitHub app designed to pull user codebases and conduct code reviews by analyzing the differences in pull requests (PRs). Demonstrating his expertise, he successfully deployed the app as a serverless solution."
moreInfoTwo: " Ali's contributions extended to the development of REST APIs and their seamless integration into the admin portal, which was constructed using Next.js. The technologies harnessed in this project encompass Node, Next.js, Python, Postgres, AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model), AWS Serverless, and AWS CloudFront. This makes the product an invaluable resource for developers and Product/Project managers seeking efficient codebase exploration and documentation generation."
