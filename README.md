## Background

This repository is used to hold the code for the website of [Prixite](https://prixite.com). Prixite is a leading software development company of Pakistan. It has offices in Lahore, Pakistan and Wyoming, USA.

This repository can also be used as a starter template for a Next.js project. The code in this repository is freely distributed.

Some interesting things you can learn from this template:
- Deployment of Next.js static website to Github Pages.
- Github Workflows
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- TypeScript with React.js and Next.js
- Integration of linters and formatters.

You can also use this template to create and host a free website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or any other static website host. Advantages of a static website:
- Speed 🚀
- Security 🛡️
- Scalability 🙌

## Requirements:

Node: >=16
yarn: >= 1

## Getting Started

First, Create an environment file (.env) in the root of the project. You can get the initial file by copying env.sample to .env

Second, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Contributing
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/prixite/prixite.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute to this project.

## Future Plan
We would like to reach to a place where anyone can fork this template, make few changes, and create a free website. For this to happen, following needs to happen:
- a DB file to hold data of the website. Data should be separate from layout. https://github.com/prixite/prixite.github.io/issues/67
- a system to create layout of pages.
- a set of components which can be used in pages.
- a system to change theme easily.
- a system to change type of site, e.g. change from corporate to a blog.
- maybe we should also separate style from layout.
