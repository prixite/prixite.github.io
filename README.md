## Background

This repository is used to hold the code for the website of [Prixite](https://prixite.com). Prixite is a leading software development company of Pakistan. It has offices in Lahore, Pakistan and Wyoming, USA.

This repository can also be used as a starter template for a Next.js project. The code in this repository is freely distributed.

Some interesting things you can learn from this template:

- Deployment of Next.js static website to Github Pages.
- Github Workflows
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- TypeScript with React.js and Next.js
- Integration of linters and formatters.

You can also use this template to create and host a free website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or any other static website host. Advantages of a static website:

- Speed 🚀
- Security 🛡️
- Scalability 🙌

## Requirements:

Node: >=16
